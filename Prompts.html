              Go look at Jaiden's response, he answers this better.
            </p>
            <p>Jaiden: It depends. It has a few advantages and a few disadvantages. If you build up your image skillfully, people will like you, but if you don't care about the things you are doing, people will think of you and treat you poorly.</p>

            <h3>Examples of Wealth</h3>
            Adrian:  The first thing I think of is The Necklace. No doubt about it, that story is completely centered around money.<br>
            Jaiden:  The Necklace is the first thing I thought about. The story is almost completly centere around money and wealth because Mathilde had to work to get the money to buy the extra necklace because she had lost the one she borrowed. Wealth has to do with "The Gift of the Magi" becuase they spend their money on each other while sacrificing things of their own. For example, Della sold her hair for money to buy a gold chain for her husband, but the husband sold the watch that the chain goes with so he could buy a comb for Della's hair. <br>
            Adrian:  Sheesh, Jaiden! I only did one line!
            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            Adrian: "she dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was unhappy as if she had really fallen from a higher station;" <br>
            Must I say more? She's greedy and wanted all the wealth! <br>
            Jaiden:
